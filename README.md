# CRSRA_Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_in_R
In this repository I publish the final course project exercises from "Getting And Cleaing Data In R"

The R code that I present in the TXT file should contain a script that 
.. automatically downloads a ZIP archive from the internet which contains a couple of data files with geroscopic data from a survey with 30 participants: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

The aim is to extract the relevant files from this ZIP archive, clean the data, merge them together and replace the column names. Further a lookup join shall be performed to add some understandable "activity labels" to the label codes in the data set so that in the end the data set is "tidy" and ready for analysing.

A second dataset is then built from the tidy dataset which only contains the mean values for each columns, grouped by the activity labels.
